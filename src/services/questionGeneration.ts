    const prompt = `
          You are an expert technical interviewer conducting a ${jobRole} interview for a candidate with ${experienceLevel} years of experience. 
          
          ANALYZE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CAREFULLY:
  
          === JOB DESCRIPTION ===
          ${jobDescription}
          
          === CANDIDATE'S RESUME ===
          ${resumeInfo}
  
          TASK: Generate exactly 10 highly personalized and relevant interview questions based on the analysis above.
  
          ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
          1. Identify key technical skills mentioned in the job description
          2. Match candidate's experience with job requirements
          3. Find gaps or areas to explore further
          4. Consider the experience level for question difficulty
          5. Look for specific projects, companies, or technologies the candidate has worked with
          6. Pay special attention to projects section for technical deep-dive questions
  
          QUESTION GENERATION RULES:
          
          TECHNICAL QUESTIONS (2 out of 3):
          - Focus on technologies/frameworks mentioned in BOTH job description AND resume
          - Reference specific projects by name and ask about technical decisions
          - Ask about architecture choices and challenges in their projects
          - Include system design questions for senior roles (3+ years)
          - Ask about trade-offs and decision-making in technical choices
          - Include coding/problem-solving scenarios relevant to the job
          - Deep dive into project technologies and implementation details
          
          BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS (1 out of 3):
          - Reference specific experiences from their resume
          - Ask about transitions between companies/roles
          - Explore leadership experience for senior positions
          - Focus on situations relevant to the job requirements
          - Ask about challenges specific to their industry/domain
  
          PERSONALIZATION EXAMPLES:
          - Instead of "Tell me about a time you debugged an issue" 
          - Use "I see you worked at [Company] on [Technology]. Tell me about a challenging debugging scenario you faced with [specific tech stack]"
          
          - Instead of "Describe a project you worked on"
          - Use "I noticed your [Project Name] project used [Technology]. What challenges did you face implementing [specific feature] and how did you solve them?"
          
          - Instead of "How do you handle conflicts?"
          - Use "Moving from [Previous Company] to [Current Company], how did you adapt to different team dynamics?"
  
          - Instead of "Tell me about your experience with [Technology]"
          - Use "In your [Project Name] project, you used [Technology]. How did you decide on this tech stack and what would you do differently now?"
  
          DIFFICULTY SCALING:
          - 0-2 years: Focus on fundamentals, learning ability, basic problem-solving
          - 3-5 years: Architecture decisions, team collaboration, complex problem-solving
          - 5+ years: System design, leadership, strategic thinking, mentoring
  
          OUTPUT FORMAT:
          Return exactly 10 questions as a JSON object. Each question must be:
          - Highly specific to this candidate and role
          - Professional and clear
          - Appropriate for the experience level
          - Either technical or behavioral (specified in type)
